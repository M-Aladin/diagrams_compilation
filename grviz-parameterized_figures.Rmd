A great benefit of designing figures within R is that we are able to connect the figures directly with our analysis by reading R values directly into our flowcharts. For example, suppose you have created a filtering process which removes values after each stage of a process, you can have a figure show the number of values left in the dataset after each stage of your process. To do this we, you can use the @@X symbol directly within the figure, then refer to this in the footer of the plot using [X]:, where X is the a unique numeric index. Here is a basic example:


```{r}
library(DiagrammeR)


# Define some sample data
data <- list(a=1000, b=800, c=600, d=400)


DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph graph2 {

    graph [layout = dot]
    
    # node definitions with substituted label text
    node [shape = rectangle, width = 4, fillcolor = Biege]
    
    a [label = '@@1']
    b [label = '@@2']
    c [label = '@@3']
    d [label = '@@4']
    
    a -> b -> c -> d
    
    }
    
    [1]: paste0('Raw Data (n = ', data$a, ')')
    [2]: paste0('Remove Errors (n = ', data$b, ')')
    [3]: paste0('Identify Potential Customers (n = ', data$c, ')')
    [4]: paste0('Select Top Priorities (n = ', data$d, ')')
    
")

```
