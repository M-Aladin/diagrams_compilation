A crucial option to specify is the label option, which lets us change the text within the shape. . We will piece together some of the examples below to highlight a more complex graph:

```{r}
library(DiagrammeR)


DiagrammeR::grViz("digraph {

    graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]
    
    # define the global styles of the nodes. We can override these in box if we wish
    node [shape = rectangle, style = filled, fillcolor = Linen]
    
    data1 [label = 'Dataset 1', shape = folder, fillcolor = Beige]
    data2 [label = 'Dataset 2', shape = folder, fillcolor = Beige]
    
    process     [label =  'Process \n Data']
    statistical [label = 'Statistical \n Analysis']
    results     [label= 'Results']
    
    # edge definitions with the node IDs
    {data1 data2}  -> process -> statistical -> results
}")
```
